DESCRIPTION:  I practiced performing different types of joins to combine data meaningfully, such as INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins. I also explored advanced querying using window functions, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to analyze trends and patterns in datasets.

In addition, I gained hands-on experience in migrating data between databases, specifically from MySQL to PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity through verification techniques. Finally, I learned how to back up and restore databases, preparing for real-world scenarios where data loss or system failures could occur.
